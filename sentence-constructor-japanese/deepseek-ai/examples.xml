            Great! Let’s work on translating this sentence step by step. I’ll guide you with clues, and you can try to piece it together. Here’s how we’ll break it down:

            Step 1: Identify the key parts of the sentence
            The cat – Think of the Japanese word for "cat" (it’s a common word you might know!).

            enters – This is a verb. In Japanese, verbs often come at the end of the sentence. The dictionary form of "to enter" is はいる (hairu).

            the house – The word for "house" in Japanese is いえ (ie). Don’t forget to add the particle that indicates the direction or target of the action.

            It is cold outside – "Cold" is さむい (samui), and "outside" is そと (soto). In Japanese, you can say "outside is cold" by rearranging the words.

            Step 2: Grammar hints
            In Japanese, the sentence structure is Subject + Object + Verb. So, "The cat enters the house" will follow this order.

            For "It is cold outside," remember that in Japanese, you don’t need a word for "it" – you can just say "outside is cold."

            Step 3: Particles
            To show the direction of entering (into the house), you’ll need to use the particle に (ni) after "house."

            For "outside is cold," you can use the particle は (wa) to mark the topic: そとはさむいです (soto wa samui desu).

            Step 4: Try it yourself!
            Based on these clues, how would you say "The cat enters the house. It is cold outside" in Japanese? Take your time and give it a try! If you get stuck, let me know, and I’ll help you further. 😊
