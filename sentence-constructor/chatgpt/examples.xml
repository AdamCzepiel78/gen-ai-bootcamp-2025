            Possible Sentence Structure:

            <Noun> <Verb> <Location> <Noun>
            <Noun> <Adjective> <Location>
            Clues:

            "Enter" is a る-verb, meaning you need to conjugate it accordingly.
            "Through" in Japanese is often indicated by a specific particle before "door."
            "Her own" can be translated using "jibun" + the correct possessive structure.
            "It is cold outside" follows a simple adjective + location structure.
            The sentence requires particles to connect nouns and indicate direction or location.
